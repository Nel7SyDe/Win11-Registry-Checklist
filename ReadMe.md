# Purpose: Create a Script that executes a list of Registry edits that are useful for fresh installations of Windows 11

Initially, this will probably be a very "quick and dirty" .reg file or a small script with no option selection, but I'm hoping to expand it as time goes on to add more options and enable some sort of selection method.

## List of pruposed Registry Edits:
- Disable Bing search in Start Menu
- Restore classic context menu
- Remove unwanted keyboard layouts
- Remove "Home" and "Gallery" from NavigationÂ Panel
